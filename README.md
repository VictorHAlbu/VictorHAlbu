- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focused on developing ruby on rails, html, javascript and css. I have several applications developed in ruby on rails here on my GitHub, I like this technology for its production power. Being a technology lover, I also study front-end and some JavaScrpit fremeworks, because I'm always looking to grow professionally


- ðŸ”­ I am not currently working, just developing projects autonomously, looking for an opportunity as a junior developer to generate value for me in a professional manner and in knowledge and to return to work, developing my skills and growing in the company
